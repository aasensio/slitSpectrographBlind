These routines can be used to generate a sampling of atmospheric PSFs and
degrade a 3D cube extracted from a simulation of the solar atmosphere.

## genPSF.py
It generates a set of atmospheric PSFs for a telescope of 1.5 m (similar to the
GREGOR solar telescope on the Teide Observatory) with a central obscuration of 30%
and a spider. The wavefronts are obtained as linear combination of Zernike polynomials
with coefficients extracted from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean
and covariance given by the covariance matrix obtained for Kolmogorov turbulence.
The PSFs are obtained via Fourier transform of the aperture and the wavefront phases.
They have been obtained for a Fried radius of 20 cm, which is representative of
quite good observing conditions. We generate 50 PSFs per position of the spectrograph
to mimic rapid expositions.

## convolve.py
Convolve the 3D cube with the PSFs, generating an array of size [nLambda, nPix, nPix, nImages].
nLambda is the spectral direction, which can be considered for the multi-object approach.
nImages are the expositions.

## Spectra and PSFs
The files are quite heavy and I leave them in the following ftp server (anonymous):

`ftp.iac.es/out/aasensio/original_and_degraded.nf`
`ftp.iac.es/out/aasensio/psfs.nf`

The files are NetCDF files.
